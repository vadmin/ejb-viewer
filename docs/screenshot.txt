This is a placeholder for the JBoss/WildFly Manager application screenshot.

The actual screenshot would show:

1. The main application window (1000x900 pixels)
2. The connection panel at the top with fields for host, port, username, and password
3. The split pane in the center with:
   - Left side: Tree view showing JMS queues and EJBs
   - Right side: Details panel showing properties of the selected resource
4. Operation buttons for managing the selected resource
5. Status bar at the bottom showing operation feedback

To replace this placeholder with an actual screenshot:
1. Run the application
2. Take a screenshot of the main window
3. Save the screenshot as "screenshot.png" in this directory
4. Remove this text file
